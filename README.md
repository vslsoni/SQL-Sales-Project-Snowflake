# SQL-Sales-Project-Snowflake
# ETL Process and Data Analysis for Sell Phone Company

## Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) sales order data from three major regions: **Asia (India), Europe (France), and North America (USA)**. The objective was to harmonize this data into a unified structure using **Snowflake** and **SQL**, ensuring accurate and insightful data analysis through dynamic dashboards.

## Objectives
- Integrate sales order data from multiple regions into a single structured format.
- Utilize **Snowflake** as the primary data warehouse for storage and processing.
- Automate data ingestion and transformation to streamline the ETL process.
- Develop interactive dashboards for data visualization and analysis.

## Key Components

### Data Ingestion
- Loaded data in multiple formats (**CSV, JSON, and Parquet**) into **Snowflake** using internal staging.
- Ensured efficient data storage and retrieval to facilitate seamless querying and processing.

### Table Creation
- Designed and structured tables to accommodate diverse data types across different regions.
- Standardized table schemas to enable consistency and ease of querying.

### Stored Procedures
